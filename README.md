# Eatl

Configuration-based XML and CSV document parsing library.  Define structs in
YAML configuration files and parse documents to create and populate the
structs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'eatl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eatl

## Usage

The library supports creating a collection of struct of arbirary cardinality.
For example, if you're interested in capturing all the chapters from an XML
representation of a book, but also want to capture higher-level keys such as
the author:

```xml
<book>
  <author>
    <firstName>greggroth</firstName>
  </author>
  <publishedAt>2016-11-12T8:00:00Z</publishedAt>
  <rating>8.9</rating>
  <pages>120</pages>
  <chapters>
    <chapter>
      <title>Ch 1</title>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>Ch 2</title>
    </chapter>
  </chapters>
</book>
```

You can use a schema definition like:

```yaml
name: chapters
fields:
  - name: author
    xpath: //author/firstName
    type: string
  - node: chapters
    xpath: //chapters/chapter
    children:
    - name: title
      xpath: ./title
      type: string
```

Here is an example from the test suite of using this XML and schema defintion:

```ruby
> chapters = Eatl::Xml::Document.new('./spec/fixtures/schema/book.yaml' ).parse('./spec/fixtures/xml/book.xml' )
=> [#<struct Struct::Chapters author="greggroth", title="Ch 1">,
 #<struct Struct::Chapters author="greggroth", title="Ch 2">]
```

## Schema Fields Reference

### Header Attributes

- `name`
  - Name of the document this schema represents
- `table_name`
  - optional -- defaults to `name`
  - Name of the table in the `CREATE TABLE` statement generated by `Eatl::Sql::TableGenerator`
- `remove_namespaces`
  - optional -- defaults to `false`
  - only apply to XML documents and configures Whether XML namespaces ought to
    be removed before applying XPaths.

`input_field` attributes:

- `name`
  - required
  - Name of the field to be used as the `attr_accessor` in the destination struct.
- `type`
  - optional -- defaults to `string`
  - Can be
    - `boolean`
    - `float`
    - `integer`
    - `string`
    - `timestamp`
- `required`
  - optional -- defaults to `true`
  - If a node cannot be found at the given `xpath`, an `Eatl::NodeNotFound` error is raised.
- `value`
  - optional -- superceeds `xpath` or `csv_header` values
  - If set, this value will be used as the attribute's value
- `strptime`
  - optional -- only applicable if `type` is `timestamp`
  - Format string used to parse the string into a `DateTime` object
- `max_length`
  - optional -- only applicable if `type` is `string`
  - Truncate the string after `max_length` characters
- `length`
  - optional -- only applicable if `type` is `string`
  - Truncate the string after `length` characters

### Fields for `Eatl::Csv::Document` schemas

- `csv_header`
  - required
  - Name of header the field is expected to be under

### Fields for `Eatl::Xml::Document` schemas

- `xpath`
  - required
  - Path to the object in the XML document that should be used to populate this field

Node field attributes:

- `node`
  - optional
  - Name to describe this collection of nodes
- `xpath`
  - required
  - Indicates the collection of children documents to be passed to the `chilren` field definitions
- `children`:
  - required
  - Collection of normal field definitions, except their `xpath` is relative to the child document defined per the `xpath` of the parent node.

## Helpful Tools

Included are two helper classes for generating schema files from a sample XML
document and generating a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement from a schema.  Since
these are utility classes, they are _not_ `require`'d by default.

### `Eatl::Xml::SchemaGenerator`

Given a sample XML file, this class can be used to generate a schema definition.  For example, from [the spec](https://github.com/bluebottlecoffee/eatl/blob/master/spec/xml/schema_generator_spec.rb) you can see that given the XML:

```xml
<book>
  <id>1</id>
  <author>
    <firstName>greggroth</firstName>
    <lastName>roth</lastName>
  </author>
  <publisher>
    <name>BBC</name>
  </publisher>
  <publishedAt>2016-11-12T8:00:00Z</publishedAt>
  <forSale>no</forSale>
  <rating>8.9</rating>
  <pages>120</pages>
  <summary>In this lovely tale, an intrepid warrior ventures out to save a princess.</summary>
  <chapters>
    <chapter>
      <title>Ch 1</title>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>Ch 2</title>
    </chapter>
  </chapters>
</book>
```

A schema can be generated using the following:

```ruby
> require 'eatl/xml/schema_generator'
> generator = Eatl::Xml::SchemaGenerator.new('./spec/fixtures/xml/book.xml')
puts generator.schema('/book')
---
name: ''
remove_namespaces: true
fields:
- name: id
  xpath: "/book/id"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: author_first_name
  xpath: "/book/author/firstName"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: author_last_name
  xpath: "/book/author/lastName"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: publisher_name
  xpath: "/book/publisher/name"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: published_at
  xpath: "/book/publishedAt"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: for_sale
  xpath: "/book/forSale"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: rating
  xpath: "/book/rating"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: pages
  xpath: "/book/pages"
  type: string
  required: false
- name: summary
  xpath: "/book/summary"
  type: string
  required: false
- node: chapters
  xpath: "/book/chapters/chapter"
  children:
  - name: chapters_title
    xpath: "./title"
    type: string
    required: false
```

The schema generated should be treated as a starting place rather than a full
solution since no attempt is made to detect types and all fields are considered
optional by default.  Nonetheless, this can save a lot of time when setting up
new documents.

### `Eatl::Sql::TableGenerator`

This utility is helpful for generating `CREATE TABLE` statements from a schema.
From [the tests](https://github.com/bluebottlecoffee/eatl/blob/master/spec/eatl/sql/table_generator_spec.rb):

```ruby
> require 'eatl/sql/table_generator'
> generator = Eatl::Sql::TableGenerator.new('./spec/fixtures/schema/book.yaml')
> puts generator.statement
#> CREATE TABLE books (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT NOT NULL,
  library_id INT,
  pages INT NOT NULL,
  for_sale BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  published_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  rating REAL NOT NULL,
  icbn TEXT,
  summary VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);
```

When working with large schema files, this can greatly reduce the amount of
effort required to set up database tables.
